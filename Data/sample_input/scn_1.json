  "transcript": "Rounding on Maria Chen, room 3E-12. She's a 62 year old female with stage 3B NSCLC currently on cycle 3 of chemoradiation. Overnight she spiked a fever to 38.5, and her white count came back at 1.2 which is down from 2.8 yesterday. She's definitely neutropenic now. Her sats are also running low, 89 percent on 3 liters. She mentioned some blood in her sputum this morning, which is concerning given she's on the enoxaparin. I want to hold the anticoagulation for now until we sort out the hemoptysis. We need to get blood cultures times two and start her on broad spectrum antibiotics, probably pip-tazo. Also need to bump up her oxygen and get a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia. I'll touch base with oncology about whether we need to delay her next treatment. Pain is controlled, she rated it 4 out of 10. Family is aware she's having a rough night."
