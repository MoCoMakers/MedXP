{
  "risk_level": "High",
  "executive_summary": "Multiple high-risk clinical and compliance issues identified including an incomplete PRN opioid order requiring verification, unconfirmed code status in a Stage IIIB terminal patient, absent informed consent documentation for chemoradiation, and unaddressed elevated troponin with hypertension. Compliance score of 55 reflects significant documentation and protocol gaps.",
  "compliance_score": 55,
  "key_concerns": [
    "Incomplete PRN opioid order (no agent, dose, or route specified) - respiratory depression risk with SpO2 93% on room air",
    "Missing informed consent documentation for chemoradiation therapy creates major liability exposure",
    "Code status remains unconfirmed despite Stage IIIB NSCLC diagnosis and current clinical instability",
    "Elevated troponin (0.11 ng/mL) lacks cardiac monitoring protocol or provider notification",
    "Uncontrolled hypertension (167/79 mmHg) without documented management plan",
    "Enoxaparin duplication in MAR requires verification to prevent accidental extra dosing",
    "Missing 'Three Checks' verbal confirmation documentation for anticoagulant administration",
    "Missing hand hygiene and wristband verification documentation before injection",
    "Bleeding risk elevated by concurrent enoxaparin and chemoradiation-induced myelosuppression"
  ],
  "recommended_action": "Immediately verify specific opioid order with prescriber, confirm code status with patient/family, and initiate retrospective informed consent chart review while addressing cardiac marker elevation and hypertension per protocol."
