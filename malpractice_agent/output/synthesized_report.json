  "risk_level": "Critical",
  "executive_summary": "Maria Chen presents three concurrent life-threatening conditions requiring immediate intervention: active hemoptysis on therapeutic anticoagulation (Enoxaparin), neutropenic fever meeting sepsis criteria with significantly elevated procalcitonin, and unresolved code status creating significant liability exposure. Compliance score is critically low at 20/100 due to documentation gaps including missing medication verification protocols and unspecified oxygen delivery devices.",
  "compliance_score": 20,
  "key_concerns": [
    "CRITICAL: Active hemoptysis on Enoxaparin - hold anticoagulation immediately per pharmacist; risk officer notes documentation gap in clinical decision-making",
    "URGENT: Neutropenic fever (38.5°C, Procalcitonin 6.05-6.99) requires broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour per sepsis protocols",
    "HIGH LIABILITY: Code status remains unconfirmed despite Stage IIIB NSCLC, respiratory compromise, and neutropenia",
    "MODERATE: Duplicate Enoxaparin entry requires verification to rule out double-dosing error",
    "COMPLIANCE FAILURE: Zero documentation of 'Three Checks' medication verification for Enoxaparin",
    "DOCUMENTATION GAP: O2 delivery device unspecified in vitals; EHR duplicate medication entry uncorrected"
  ],
  "recommended_action": "Immediately hold Enoxaparin, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever per sepsis protocol, confirm code status with patient/family today, and verify duplicate medication entry is not a dosing error."
