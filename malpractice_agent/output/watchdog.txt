## Patient: Maria Chen (MRN100200)
## Document Type: Patient Summary / Shift Handoff Report

## Compliance Assessment

### 1. Medication Administration Verification

**Medication Identified:** Enoxaparin 40mg Subcutaneous Daily

| Check Required | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Right Patient | **NOT VERIFIED** | Patient name listed in header but no confirmation statement (e.g., "checked patient ID band") present in transcript |
| Right Drug | **NOT VERIFIED** | Drug listed in medication list but no verbal verification during administration documented |
| Right Dose | **NOT VERIFIED** | Dose (40mg) listed but no double-verification against order documented |

**Finding:** The transcript does not demonstrate the required verbal "Three Checks" typically expected when documenting medication administration.

---

### 2. Procedural Omission Detection

**Invasive Procedure Performed:** None documented in transcript

| Required Step | Applicable? | Compliance |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Hand Hygiene | Not applicable to this document type | N/A |
| Wristband Verification | Not applicable to this document type | N/A |
| Time-Out Procedure | Not applicable to this document type | N/A |

**Finding:** No procedural steps to audit as this is a summary/handoff document rather than a procedure note.

### 3. EHR Alignment & Clinical Pathway Review

| Clinical Factor | Assessment | Protocol Alignment |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Anticoagulation + Hemoptysis** | Patient on Enoxaparin with active hemoptysis listed under Active Problems | ⚠️ **CLINICAL CONCERN** - This combination requires careful risk-benefit assessment and documented clinical reasoning |
| **Oxygen Delivery Device** | Vitals list "Unspecified O2 Delivery" | ⚠️ **DOCUMENTATION GAP** - Specific device (NC, Mask, HFNC) should be documented for accurate clinical handoff |
| **Duplicate Medication Entry** | Source note: "Entry appears duplicated in source" | ⚠️ **EHR DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE** - Requires correction to prevent medication errors |

**Additional Watch Factor:** Patient has neutropenia (implied by oncology context) and is febrile (38.5°C). With rising Procalcitonin, this meets sepsis criteria. The document appropriately flags pending blood cultures and CT chest.

## Compliance Score Calculation

| Category | Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Three Checks (Med Verification) | 0/100 | 40% | 0 |
| Procedural Omissions | N/A | 20% | N/A (no procedures) |
| EHR Alignment | 50/100 | 40% | 20 |
| **FINAL COMPLIANCE SCORE** | | | **20/100** |

---

## Protocol Deviations Identified

1. **MED-001:** Absence of documented "Three Checks" verification for Enoxaparin administration
2. **DOC-001:** "Unspecified O2 Delivery" in vitals section (non-compliant with standard handoff documentation standards)
3. **DATA-001:** Duplicate medication entry in source document requiring verification and cleanup
4. **CLIN-001:** Active hemoptysis on anticoagulation lacks documented clinical decision-making or risk assessment

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Verify duplicate Enoxaparin entry in source system; confirm only one active order exists
2. **High Priority:** Specify exact O2 delivery device in all documentation
3. **Clinical Review:** Document risk-benefit assessment for continuing Enoxaparin given active hemoptysis, or implement appropriate monitoring parameters
4. **Education:** Reinforce Three Checks protocol documentation requirements

---

**Auditor Note:** This transcript represents a handoff/summary document rather than real-time medication administration. The compliance assessment reflects documentation gaps present in the summary. A direct observation of actual Enoxaparin administration would be required for complete Three Checks verification.
