### Compliance Audit Report for Patient Handoff: Maria Chen

**Audit Date:** [Current Date]  
**Auditor Role:** Clinical Compliance & Protocol Auditor  
**Patient ID:** Maria Chen (Room 3E-12)  
**Review Focus:** Nursing actions and documentation for the handoff report.

#### Summary of Findings
The patient handoff report for Maria Chen contains several key actions and tasks, but upon thorough review, there are notable protocol deviations related to medication administration and aseptic technique. Additionally, the report lacks explicit documentation of required verification steps, which could indicate gaps in adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Below is a detailed analysis.

---

#### 1. Verification of "Three Checks" for Medication Administration
- **SOP Requirement:** For all medication administrations, nurses must verbally confirm the "Three Checks" (Right Patient, Right Drug, Right Dose) before administration, as per standard nursing protocols (e.g., Joint Commission standards and facility-specific policies). This is especially critical for high-risk medications like anticoagulants (e.g., Enoxaparin).
- **Handoff Report Evidence:** The report lists "[ACTION: Enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneously daily] × 2" with a note about duplication in the source documentation requiring verification. However, there is no explicit mention of the nurse verbally confirming the Three Checks during administration.
- **Deviation Identified:** This omission could indicate a failure to comply with medication safety protocols, increasing the risk of errors (e.g., incorrect patient, drug, or dose). The duplication note highlights a need for order verification, but the absence of Three Check confirmation is a separate deviation.
- **Compliance Impact:** High-risk deviation due to potential for harm with anticoagulants.

#### 2. Omission of Procedural Steps for Invasive Procedures
- **SOP Requirement:** Before invasive procedures (e.g., subcutaneous injections like Enoxaparin), nurses must perform hand hygiene and verify patient identity using the wristband. This is mandated by infection control protocols (e.g., CDC guidelines and facility SOPs).
- **Handoff Report Evidence:** The report describes the Enoxaparin action but does not mention hand hygiene, wristband check, or other aseptic techniques before the injection. No other invasive procedures are described, but Enoxaparin administration is highlighted.
- **Deviation Identified:** This omission increases infection risk and violates standard precautions. The duplication note in the report does not excuse the lack of procedural steps for administration.
- **Compliance Impact:** Moderate deviation due to infection control concerns.

#### 3. EHR Alignment with Standard Care Pathway
- **Patient Condition:** Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on chemoradiation, with elevated temperature (38.5°C), elevated troponin (0.11 ng/mL), and SpO2 93% on room air. Key risks include arrhythmia, respiratory decompensation, and possible infection or cardiac events.
- **Handoff Actions:**
  - **Follow up CT chest result when available:** This aligns with monitoring for disease progression, infection, or cardiac issues (e.g., pulmonary embolism given Enoxaparin use). Appropriate.
  - **Assess pain level; administer PRN opioid if pain >6/10:** This is standard for pain management in cancer patients. However, with SpO2 93% and respiratory risks, caution is advised. The action does not specify additional monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry or oxygen supplementation), which might be implied but is not documented. Overall, it aligns with SOPs for PRN opioid use.
  - **Confirm code status with patient and family:** This is proactive and aligns with end-of-life care protocols, especially given the critical condition.
- **EHR Alignment Check:** No actions contradict the standard care pathway. The elevated troponin and temperature warrant follow-up, and tasks address this. The duplication note for Enoxaparin requires verification but does not inherently contradict care; it is a good safety catch.
- **Compliance Impact:** No deviations identified; actions are appropriate for the clinical presentation.

#### 4. Additional Observations
- **Note on Duplication:** The Enoxaparin duplication ("× 2") is flagged for verification with the MAR. This is a positive step for accuracy but is not a procedural deviation. It should be resolved to prevent errors.
- **Risk Monitoring:** The clinical risks (arrhythmia, respiratory decompensation) are acknowledged in the report, and tasks like CT follow-up and pain assessment indirectly address these. No gaps are noted.

#### Compliance Score Calculation
- **Base Score:** 100 (assuming full compliance with SOPs).
- **Deductions:**
  - Deviation 1 (Missing Three Checks confirmation): -15 points (due to high risk with anticoagulants).
  - Deviation 2 (Missing hand hygiene/asptic technique): -10 points (infection control risk).
- **Final Compliance Score:** **75/100**

**Score Interpretation:** 
- 75 indicates moderate compliance with significant room for improvement. The deviations are primarily documentation-related but pose patient safety risks if not addressed.

#### Protocol Deviations Summary
1. **Medication Administration Error Risk:** No documented verbal confirmation of the "Three Checks" (Right Patient, Right Drug, Right Dose) for Enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneous administration. This violates standard medication safety protocols.
2. **Aseptic Technique Omission:** No mention of hand hygiene or wristband verification before the subcutaneous injection of Enoxaparin, increasing infection risk.

#### Recommendations for Improvement
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Reinforce with nursing staff the requirement to verbally confirm and document the Three Checks before all medication administrations.
  - Ensure hand hygiene and patient identification are performed and documented before invasive procedures.
  - Verify the Enoxaparin order duplication with the MAR to resolve the discrepancy.
- **Systemic Enhancements:**
  - Incorporate mandatory checklist prompts for Three Checks and aseptic technique in the electronic health record (EHR) to reduce omissions.
  - Provide targeted training on high-risk medication management (e.g., anticoagulants) and infection control for cancer patients.
- **Follow-Up:** Schedule a brief debrief with the outgoing nurse to clarify if these steps were performed but not documented, to avoid future compliance gaps.
