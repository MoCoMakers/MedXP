## PHARMACOVIGILANCE ASSESSMENT

### ⚠️ HIGH-PRIORITY SAFETY FLAGS IDENTIFIED

---

#### 1. ⚡ CRITICAL: Bleeding Risk - Hemoptysis + Anticoagulation

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Medication** | Enoxaparin 40mg SC Daily |
| **Risk Factor** | Active Hemoptysis |
| **Assessment** | **PROHIBITED COMBINATION** |

**CLINICAL ALERT:** This patient has **active hemoptysis** (flagged in Active Problems) while concurrently receiving **therapeutic anticoagulation with Enoxaparin**. This creates a significant risk of worsening pulmonary hemorrhage.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- ⏸️ **HOLD Enoxaparin immediately** pending bleeding risk assessment
- Consider if anticoagulation is essential (e.g., high VTE risk vs. active bleeding)
- If anticoagulation must continue, ensure platelet count is adequate
- Monitor hemoglobin trend closely (currently 9.7 g/dL)

#### 2. 🚨 URGENT: Neutropenic Fever - Requires Immediate Antibiotic Intervention

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 38.5°C (101.3°F) | Fever |
| Procalcitonin | 6.05-6.99 ng/mL | **Significantly elevated** (suggests bacterial infection) |
| Neutropenia | Implied | Chemoradiation context |
| SpO2 | 93% (baseline low 90s) | Respiratory compromise |

**CRITICAL GAP:** This patient meets criteria for **neutropenic sepsis**. With fever, documented pulmonary infiltrate, and severely elevated procalcitonin, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated **immediately**—not held pending CT results.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- 🧪 Obtain blood cultures (if not already done)
- 💉 Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics within **1 hour** of fever recognition
- Coverage should include Pseudomonas and typical/atypical pathogens
- Consider antifungal coverage if no improvement in 48-72 hours

---

#### 3. ⚠️ WATCH: Cardiac Risk - Troponin Elevation + Hypoxemia

| Factor | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| Troponin | 0.11 ng/mL (elevated) |
| SpO2 | 93% with dips to mid-80s |
| HR | Stable at 78 bpm |
| BP | Hypertensive (167/79 mmHg) |

**ASSESSMENT:** Elevated troponin likely represents **demand ischemia** secondary to:
- Chronic hypoxemia
- Respiratory distress
- Fever-induced tachycardia (if present)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Serial troponin monitoring
- Aggressive oxygen optimization (target SpO2 >92% given chronic hypoxemia baseline)
- Avoid tachycardia-inducing medications
- Ensure adequate pain control (pain/stress increases cardiac demand)

---

#### 4. 📋 MEDICATION VERIFICATION REQUIRED

**Duplicate Entry Detected:**
> *"[ACTION: Enoxaparin 40mg Subcutaneous Daily] *(Note: Entry appears duplicated in source)*"*

**ACTION:** Verify that Enoxaparin is not being administered **twice daily** (double-dose error potential). If the duplicate entry represents a scheduled dose that was administered, this could constitute a **supratherapeutic anticoagulation state**.

**RECOMMENDATION:** 
- Clarify medication administration record
- Confirm Enoxaparin frequency is truly **once daily**
- Check anti-Xa levels if clinically indicated

---

### SUMMARY OF REQUIRED ACTIONS

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **IMMEDIATE** | Hold Enoxaparin due to hemoptysis |
| 🔴 **IMMEDIATE** | Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever |
| 🟡 **THIS SHIFT** | Verify Enoxaparin dosing frequency |
| 🟡 **THIS SHIFT** | Serial troponin monitoring |
| 🟢 **FOLLOW-UP** | CT chest review when available |
