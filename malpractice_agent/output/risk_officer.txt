## Risk Evaluation Report: Maria Chen (MRN100200)

**Evaluation Date:** January 30
**Assessor:** Medical-Legal Risk & Ethics Review
**Document Type:** Patient Summary / Shift Handoff Report

---

### Executive Summary

This evaluation is significantly limited by the nature of the provided document, which is a summary abstraction rather than a clinical note containing patient interactions. The "Clean Transcript" lacks the dialogue, procedural documentation, and patient communication details necessary for a comprehensive soft-risk assessment. **No definitive liability flags can be confirmed or excluded based on this document alone.** The following analysis identifies what risks can be assessed and where critical information is absent.

---

### Category I: Sentiment & Tone Analysis

**Assessment:** Cannot Be Evaluated

The provided document is an abstraction/summary containing no dialogue between healthcare providers and the patient. There is no staff-patient interaction documented, and therefore no opportunity to assess for dismissive, aggressive, or condescending language. This category requires access to nursing notes, provider progress notes, or recorded conversations.

**Recommendation:** Request full nursing notes and provider documentation for sentiment review.

---

### Category II: Informed Consent & Procedural Documentation

**Assessment:** Cannot Be Evaluated

The document references pending procedures (CT chest, blood cultures) and current treatments (Enoxaparin, chemoradiation), but does not document:

- Informed consent discussions for the chemoradiation regimen
- Consent documentation for blood product administration (implied by anemia management)
- Patient understanding or questions regarding the high-risk anticoagulation therapy given concurrent hemoptysis
- Discussion of risks/benefits/alternatives for any procedures performed or pending

**Documentation Gap Identified:** The summary references a "potential duplicate medication entry" but does not clarify whether this represents an actual medication error or simply a charting artifact. This ambiguity creates liability exposure if the patient received duplicate doses of Enoxaparin.

**Recommendation:** Verify the Enoxaparin duplication immediately. Obtain signed consent documentation for active treatments. Flag for review whether the patient has received adequate informed consent regarding the risks of anticoagulation with concurrent hemoptysis.

### Category III: Documentation Gaps – Patient Expression of Concerns

**Assessment:** Cannot Be Evaluated

The abstract format provides no record of patient-reported symptoms, complaints, or concerns expressed during the documented timeframe. There is no mechanism to identify whether the patient voiced symptoms (e.g., increased dyspnea, pain, anxiety) that were not addressed.

**Observations from Vital Signs with Potential Clinical Significance:**
The vital signs reveal a clinically concerning pattern that should trigger proactive nursing assessment even without patient complaint:

- **Fever (38.5°C):** Indicates active infectious/inflammatory process. The document notes "pending blood cultures" but does not document when these were ordered or drawn, nor any antipyretic interventions.
- **Hypertensive Urgency (167/79):** The patient has a known hypertensive baseline, but this elevation warrants assessment for pain, anxiety, or end-organ stress.
- **Persistent Hypoxemia (93% on unspecified oxygen):** Below patient's chronic baseline of "low 90s." No documentation of patient symptoms (dyspnea, air hunger) or intervention effectiveness.

**Recommendation:** The absence of documented patient-reported symptoms is not itself a risk if nursing assessments were performed and simply not captured in this summary format. However, the clinical picture warrants proactive symptom management and documentation of patient response to interventions.

### Category IV: Admissions of Fault / Liability Statements

**Assessment:** No Liability Flags Identified

The provided document contains no "I'm sorry" statements, admissions of fault, expressions of regret, or statements acknowledging error. This category is clear.

---

### Additional Liability Considerations Identified

#### 1. Code Status Documentation
The summary notes "Confirm code status with patient/family" as an outstanding task. For a patient with Stage IIIB NSCLC on chemoradiation with respiratory compromise and neutropenia, unresolved code status represents a significant liability exposure. Clinical deterioration could necessitate emergency resuscitation that may not align with patient goals.

**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Recommendation:** Code status confirmation should be prioritized as an urgent task, with documentation of the discussion and patient/family understanding.

#### 2. Isolation Status
The patient is on Contact isolation, but the summary does not document:
- The reason for isolation
- Whether the patient understands isolation requirements
- Whether isolation impacts care delivery or patient rights

**Recommendation:** Verify isolation rationale and ensure patient education documented.

#### 3. Anticoagulation in Hemoptysis
The patient has documented hemoptysis and is receiving Enoxaparin 40mg daily. This represents a known risk-benefit tension. The summary does not document:
- Risk-benefit discussion with patient
- Frequency/severity of hemoptysis events
- Hematology or provider rationale for continuing anticoagulation

**Risk Level:** MODERATE-HIGH
**Recommendation:** Document clinical reasoning for anticoagulation continuation. Consider hematology consultation.

### Summary Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Status | Risk Level |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| Sentiment/Tone | Not assessable from summary | UNKNOWN |
| Informed Consent | Insufficient documentation | MODERATE |
| Patient Concerns | Not documented | UNKNOWN |
| Admissions of Fault | None identified | LOW |
| Code Status | Outstanding task | HIGH |
| Med Safety (Enoxaparin dup) | Requires verification | MODERATE |

---

### Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Clarify Enoxaparin duplication** – Determine if duplicate dosing occurred and document accordingly.
2. **Complete code status confirmation** – This is a liability exposure given patient acuity.
3. **Obtain consent documentation** for chemoradiation and blood administration.
4. **Document clinical reasoning** for anticoagulation with hemoptysis.
5. **Request full clinical notes** for comprehensive soft-risk assessment including sentiment analysis.
